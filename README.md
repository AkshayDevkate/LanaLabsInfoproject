## Visualization 

LANA Process Mining builds a complete process model from your process data in a matter of seconds. Here you can see not only how and in how many variants your processes are actually executed in daily business. The intuitive visualization also draws your attention directly to critical values: bottlenecks, high processing times and long idle times

## Conformance checking 

Whether you upload your own target model of your process or have LANA simply create a new one, the tool automatically detects all discernible process deviations by comparing the target and actual states. Instead of having to search for discrepancies yourself, LANA immediately shows you where there is potential for optimization or a business risk.

## Root Cause Analysis

LANA’s automated root cause analysis uses an intelligent Machine Learning algorithm to identify patterns in your processes. This allows you to automatically identify the root causes of your process problems – through data instead of speculation. Create a fact-based optimization strategy.

## KPI Monitoring

With LANA’s flexible, customizable dashboards, you can keep track of all relevant metrics during and after analysis, whether end-to-end or focused on specific areas. Especially useful: Share dashboards with your team to have a common foundation for strategic optimization and control.
